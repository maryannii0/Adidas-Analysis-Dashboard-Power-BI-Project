# Adidas-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
In this project, I utilized Power BI to create an interactive sales performance dashboard for Adidas. The process involved data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to uncover key business insights.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Adidasâ€™s sales performance, highlighting total sales, operating profit, and unit sales. Visuals such as area charts, filled maps, donut charts, and bar charts reveal insights on monthly sales trends, regional performance, top-performing products, and key retailers.
